# FutbolChallenge
Learning how to setup, code to and debug Service Fabric applications and WinUI front-end applications.

The basic idea is to track game players (Participants) score guessing for futbol matches for an entire season.

The system will track: Participants, Seasons (divided into MatchGroups), ScheduledGames (and the resulting scores).

The system will calculate Participants scores assigning 3 points to a correct prediction, 2 points if the prediction
identifies the correct winning team and margin and 1 point if the correct team is guessed.

This is a work in progress and is intended as a learning exercise.
